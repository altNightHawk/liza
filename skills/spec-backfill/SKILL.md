# Objective

Reconstruct specifications from a repository's codebase, existing documentation, and git history.
You're doing archaeology — finding the *features* buried in code and docs, then surfacing them as structured specs.

A spec is warranted when code implements user-facing functionality or business logic. Not every module needs a spec.
Your job is to find the functional boundaries and document them.

# Process

1. **Gather** — Read existing specs, docs, code, git history, and mapping state
2. **Classify code** — Distinguish functional code (needs specs) from architectural (needs ADRs) from utility (needs neither)
3. **Map code to specs** — Identify existing coverage, gaps, and conflicts
4. **Ask** — Surface unknowns, request clarification. No guessing.
5. **Generate** — Produce/amend specs only after confirmation
6. **Verify** — Ensure no relevant legacy content dropped
7. **Archive** — Move superseded specs to `_archive` after confirmation
8. **Persist** — Update mapping and changelog

Maintain state in files so work isn't lost if the conversation ends.

# 1. Code Classification

## Functional (needs spec coverage)

- User-facing features and workflows
- Business logic and domain rules
- API endpoints that serve external consumers
- Data transformations with business meaning
- Integration points with business significance

## Architectural (needs ADR coverage, separate skill)

- Infrastructure decisions (deployment, CI/CD)
- Technology choices (frameworks, libraries)
- Cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging, caching)
- System boundaries and module structure

## Utility (needs neither)

- Helper functions and utilities
- Generated code
- Test infrastructure
- Dev tooling
- Pure technical plumbing

## Judgment calls

When uncertain, ask: "If a product manager asked 'what does this do for users?', would there be a meaningful answer?" If yes, it's functional.

# 2. Hierarchy Relationship

## Build hierarchy (source of truth, time-oriented)

```
specs/build/
  0.md           # Vision — why the product exists
  1.1.md         # Epic — large user-facing goal
  1.1.1.md       # User Story — specific user need
  changelog.md
```

Build captures *intent* — what we set out to do and when.

## Functional hierarchy (derived view, navigation-oriented)

```
specs/functional/
  0.md           # Product description — what it is today
  1.1.md         # Domain — bounded context
  1.1.1.md       # Feature — specific capability
  changelog.md
```

Functional captures *current state* — what exists now and how it's organized.

## Relationship

- Build **generates** Functional: epics/stories become domains/features when implemented
- Functional gaps **trigger** build investigation: missing feature → check epic history
- During backfill: **populate build first**, derive functional from it
- Both can exist independently, but functional without build loses historical context

## Numbering convention

Hierarchical numbering reflects parent-child relationships:
- `1.1.md` = first child of root
- `1.1.1.md` = first child of 1.1
- `1.2.md` = second child of root (sibling of 1.1)

# 3. Coverage Analysis

## Mapping code to specs

For each functional code path, determine:
- Does a spec exist? → Check alignment
- No spec exists? → Flag as gap
- Spec exists but conflicts with code? → Flag as conflict

## Coverage report structure

```
Coverage Report
===============
Covered:     src/billing/invoice.py → specs/functional/1.2.1.md (Feature: Invoicing)
Gap:         src/notifications/email.py → No spec (appears to be email notifications)
Conflict:    src/auth/login.py → specs/functional/1.1.1.md (code has MFA, spec doesn't mention it)
```

## Conflict types

- **Spec ahead of code**: Spec describes feature not yet implemented
- **Code ahead of spec**: Code has functionality not in spec
- **Semantic mismatch**: Both exist but describe different behavior
- **Stale spec**: Spec describes removed functionality

# 4. Gates (when to stop and ask)

**Code classification ambiguity**
> "I'm unsure whether `src/lib/pricing_engine.py` is functional (business logic) or utility (calculation helper).
> It computes discounts based on customer tier. How do you see it?"

**Spec mapping unclear**
> "Code in `src/orders/fulfillment.py` handles shipping, returns, and tracking. Should this map to one feature or three?"

**Business intent unknown**
> "This module processes webhook events from Stripe. I can see *what* it does but not *why* — what business need does this serve?"

**Conflict resolution**
> "Spec says users can have max 5 projects. Code enforces max 10. Which is correct — should I update the spec or flag this as a bug?"

**Gap prioritization**
> "I found 12 code paths without specs. Should I generate specs for all, or which are highest priority?"

Always ask before generating a spec. Present your analysis, let the user confirm or correct.

# 5. Spec Generation

## From code (gap filling)

When generating a spec for undocumented code:

1. Extract observable behavior from code
2. Identify inputs, outputs, side effects
3. Note business rules and constraints
4. **Ask user** for: purpose, user story, acceptance criteria
5. Generate spec only after confirmation

## From existing docs (migration)

When migrating legacy docs to spec structure:

1. Identify content that maps to features
2. Preserve all relevant information
3. **Ask user** to confirm nothing important is dropped
4. Archive original in `specs/_archive`

# 6. Changelog Reconstruction

## From git history

Parse git history of spec documents to rebuild changelog:

1. Identify creation dates (first commit)
2. Track significant modifications (not typo fixes)
3. Note status transitions (draft → active, active → deprecated)
4. **Ask for clarification** on ambiguous commits

## Changelog format

```markdown
# Changelog

## [YYYY-MM-DD]
- Added: Feature 1.2.3 (Email notifications)
- Modified: Feature 1.1.1 (Login) — added MFA requirement
- Deprecated: Feature 1.3.1 (Legacy export)

## [YYYY-MM-DD]
- ...
```

## Ambiguous changes

When commit message doesn't clarify intent:
> "Commit abc123 modified specs/functional/1.2.1.md significantly but message just says 'updates'. What changed and why?"

# 7. Verification

Before finalizing any run:

1. **Coverage check** — All functional code has spec mapping
2. **Content preservation** — No relevant legacy content dropped
3. **Consistency check** — No internal contradictions in specs
4. **Link integrity** — All cross-references (ADRs, code paths) valid

## Legacy content handling

When archiving old specs:
1. Diff old vs. new content
2. Surface any content in old not in new
3. **Ask user**: "This content exists in legacy but not in new spec: [content]. Should it be added, or is it obsolete?"
4. Only archive after confirmation

# 8. Location

```

  build/
    0.md           # Vision
    1.1.md         # Epic
    1.1.1.md       # User Story
    ...
    changelog.md

    0.md           # Product description

    ...
    changelog.md

  spec-backfill-state.yaml  # Session state (temporary)
  _archive/                 # Superseded specs (preserve history)
```

One document per node. One changelog per hierarchy.

# Quality Bar

A good backfilled spec:
- Could have been written before the code was built
- Describes *what* and *for whom*, not implementation details
- Stands alone (reader doesn't need to read the code)
- Is honest about what's confirmed vs. inferred
- Links to relevant ADRs for *why* decisions were made

A bad backfilled spec:
- Just describes the code structure
- Invents requirements the user didn't confirm
- Mixes multiple features in one document
- Contains implementation details instead of behavior
- Conflicts with the actual code

# Anti-patterns to Avoid

- **Inventing requirements**: If you don't know the business need, ask. Don't fabricate.
- **Generating without code validation**: Every spec claim must be verifiable against code.
- **Guessing business intent**: Code shows *what*, not *why for users*. Ask.
- **Dropping legacy content silently**: Always surface what's being removed for confirmation.
- **Over-specifying implementation**: Specs describe behavior, not code structure.
- **Ignoring conflicts**: Surface mismatches explicitly, don't paper over them.

# Getting Started

When the user invokes this skill:

1. Check for existing state (`specs/spec-backfill-state.yaml`), offer to resume
2. If starting fresh, begin with code classification
3. Show the user your classification for validation
4. Map existing specs to code, surface gaps and conflicts
5. **Ask** which gaps to prioritize
6. Generate specs one at a time, confirming each before proceeding
7. Verify no legacy content lost before archiving
8. Update mapping and changelog
