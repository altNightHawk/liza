# Contract Failure Mode Map

**Purpose:** Maintenance reference mapping contract clauses to documented agent failure modes.
**Not for agent consumption** — zero runtime context cost.

**Sources:**
- MAST: Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy (Berkeley, 2025) — 14 modes from 1600+ traces
- LLM Behavioral Research: Sycophancy, deception, hallucination studies (2024-2025)
- Code Generation Studies: Da et al. 2023, Xia et al. 2024
- Instruction Following: AgentIF benchmark (2025)

## Maintenance Notes

**When modifying the contract:**
1. Check this map for affected failure modes
2. Ensure coverage is preserved or explicitly transferred
3. Update line numbers after structural changes

**When new failure modes are documented:**
1. Add to appropriate category
2. Identify covering clause or flag as gap
3. If gap: propose contract addition

**Known limitations:**
- Context degradation detection relies on agent self-monitoring
- Alignment faking (DEC-4 in some taxonomies) cannot be addressed at prompt level
- Assumption counting games require Rule 1 (Integrity) as backstop
