# Contract System

Behavioral rules governing agent conduct across pairing and multi-agent modes.

## Description

The contract system transforms AI agents from unreliable assistants into accountable engineering peers. It codifies expected behaviors through tiered rules, explicit state machines, and mode-specific gate semantics.

Contracts are prompt-injected behavioral constraints, not code. They work by shaping agent responses before they happen, rather than validating after.

## Features

- 1.1.1 — [Tier System](../../contracts/CORE.md) — Priority hierarchy (Tier 0-3) with explicit degradation
- 1.1.2 — [Golden Rules](../../contracts/CORE.md) — 14 rules covering integrity, scope, validation, and collaboration
- 1.1.3 — [Execution State Machine](../../contracts/CORE.md) — IDLE → ANALYSIS → READY → EXECUTION → VALIDATION → DONE
- 1.1.4 — [Pairing Mode](../../contracts/PAIRING_MODE.md) — Human-supervised with approval gates
- 1.1.5 — [Multi-Agent Mode](../../contracts/MULTI_AGENT_MODE.md) — Peer-supervised with checkpoint gates
- 1.1.6 — [Security Protocol](../../contracts/CORE.md) — Secrets handling, credential file prohibition
- 1.1.7 — [Recovery Protocols](../../contracts/CORE.md) — RESET, Source Contradiction, Tool Failure, Batch Rollback

## Boundaries

**In scope:**
- Agent behavioral constraints
- State machine and gate semantics
- Mode-specific protocols
- Security and recovery procedures

**Out of scope:**
- Runtime coordination (see 1.2 Multi-Agent Coordination)
- Task workflow (see 1.3 Task Management)
- Specific domain skills (see 1.6 Skills)
