# Skills

Domain-specific agent protocols loaded conditionally.

## Description

Skills are specialized procedures agents load when entering specific domains. They provide methodology within contract constraints — contract gates remain non-negotiable, skill steps operate within them.

Each skill is a single markdown file (`SKILL.md`) containing triggers, process steps, and quality criteria.

## Features

- 1.6.1 — [Debugging](../../skills/debugging/SKILL.md) — Mandatory before any debugging; hypothesis-driven
- 1.6.2 — [Testing](../../skills/testing/SKILL.md) — Test design and analysis protocols
- 1.6.3 — [Code Review](../../skills/code-review/SKILL.md) — P0-P3 priority review methodology
- 1.6.4 — [Software Architecture Review](../../skills/software-architecture-review/SKILL.md) — Structural evaluation
- 1.6.5 — [Code Cleaning](../../skills/code-cleaning/SKILL.md) — Pre-commit refactoring (Python-focused)
- 1.6.6 — [Spec Review](../../skills/spec-review/SKILL.md) — Specification validation
- 1.6.7 — [Generic Subagent](../../skills/generic-subagent/SKILL.md) — Read-only work delegation
- 1.6.8 — [Systemic Thinking](../../skills/systemic-thinking/SKILL.md) — Coherence and risk analysis

Bonus skills to be used on user's request:
- 1.6.9 — [ADR Backfill](../../skills/adr-backfill/SKILL.md) — Extract ADRs from git history
- 1.6.10 — [Spec Backfill](../../skills/spec-backfill/SKILL.md) — Reconstruct specs from code
- 1.6.11 — [Feynman](../../skills/feynman/SKILL.md) — Explain complex ideas simply

## Boundaries

**In scope:**
- Domain-specific procedures
- Skill triggers and loading
- Quality criteria per skill

**Out of scope:**
- Contract rules (skills operate within them)
- Runtime coordination (see 1.2)
