# Worktree Isolation

Per-task git worktrees for isolated workspaces.

## Description

Each task gets its own git worktree, branched from the integration branch. Coders work in isolation — their changes cannot affect other tasks until explicitly merged after Code Reviewer approval.

Worktree creation and merge are supervisor-controlled. Coders can only commit to their assigned worktree. This structural separation prevents accidental cross-contamination.

## Features

- 1.4.1 — [Worktree Lifecycle](../protocols/worktree-management.md) — Create on claim, delete on terminal state
- 1.4.2 — [Branch Strategy](../protocols/worktree-management.md) — main → integration → task worktrees
- 1.4.3 — [Commit Permissions](../protocols/worktree-management.md) — Coder: worktree only, Supervisor: integration
- 1.4.4 — [Merge Protocol](../protocols/worktree-management.md) — Supervisor-executed after APPROVED
- 1.4.5 — [Reassignment Handling](../protocols/worktree-management.md) — Fresh worktree on different coder
- 1.4.6 — [Conflict Resolution](../protocols/worktree-management.md) — INTEGRATION_FAILED state
