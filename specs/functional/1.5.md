# Circuit Breaker

Systemic failure detection and recovery.

## Description

The circuit breaker is an observer that detects patterns indicating upstream problems — issues that task-level fixes cannot resolve. It reads anomalies logged by agents, identifies systemic patterns, and escalates to human intervention.

The circuit breaker never proposes solutions or modifies artifacts. It observes and reports.

## Features

- 1.5.1 — [Anomaly Collection](../protocols/circuit-breaker.md) — Structured anomaly logging by agents
- 1.5.2 — [Pattern Detection](../protocols/circuit-breaker.md) — Systemic vs local failure classification
- 1.5.3 — [Severity Levels](../protocols/circuit-breaker.md) — WARNING, CRITICAL, HALT
- 1.5.4 — [CHECKPOINT Creation](../protocols/circuit-breaker.md) — Human intervention trigger
- 1.5.5 — [Report Generation](../protocols/circuit-breaker.md) — circuit_breaker_report.md
- 1.5.6 — [Early Warning](../protocols/task-lifecycle.md) — Thresholds before limits hit

## Boundaries

**In scope:**
- Anomaly aggregation and analysis
- Pattern recognition
- Escalation to human
- Report generation

**Out of scope:**
- Solution proposal (prohibited)
- Artifact modification (prohibited)
- Task-level iteration (see 1.3 Task Management)
