# Multi-Agent Coordination

Blackboard-based coordination for peer-supervised agent collaboration.

## Description

Liza agents coordinate through a shared YAML blackboard — all state is visible, all transitions are atomic. The blackboard replaces hidden message passing with observable file operations. Humans can inspect coordination state at any time.

Three roles (Planner, Coder, Code Reviewer) interact through the blackboard without direct communication. Each reads the current state, performs work, and writes updates atomically.

## Features

- 1.2.1 — [Blackboard Schema](../architecture/blackboard-schema.md) — state.yaml structure, field semantics
- 1.2.2 — [Roles](../architecture/roles.md) — Planner, Coder, Code Reviewer responsibilities
- 1.2.3 — [State Machines](../architecture/state-machines.md) — Task states, agent states, exit codes
- 1.2.4 — [Atomic Operations](../architecture/blackboard-schema.md) — flock-based locking, read-modify-write
- 1.2.5 — [Leases](../architecture/overview.md) — Time-bounded task ownership
- 1.2.6 — [Activity Log](../architecture/blackboard-schema.md) — Append-only audit trail (log.yaml)

## Boundaries

**In scope:**
- Blackboard structure and operations
- Role definitions and constraints
- State transitions and validation
- Lease management and staleness

**Out of scope:**
- Contract rules (see 1.1 Contract System)
- Task iteration protocol (see 1.3 Task Management)
- Git isolation (see 1.4 Worktree Isolation)
