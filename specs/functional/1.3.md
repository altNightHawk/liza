# Task Management

Claim, iterate, review, merge flow for tasks.

## Description

Tasks flow through a defined lifecycle managed by the three roles. Planner decomposes goals into tasks, Coders claim and iterate, Code Reviewers approve or reject. Each transition has explicit triggers and validation requirements.

The Ralph-style loop ensures coders iterate until externally approved — they cannot self-certify completion. Hard limits prevent infinite loops.

## Features

- 1.3.1 — [Task Lifecycle](../protocols/task-lifecycle.md) — DRAFT → UNCLAIMED → CLAIMED → IN_REVIEW → APPROVED/REJECTED
- 1.3.2 — [Iteration Protocol](../protocols/task-lifecycle.md) — Ralph-style loop with max iterations
- 1.3.3 — [Review Submission](../protocols/task-lifecycle.md) — Commit SHA verification, clean git status
- 1.3.4 — [Verdict Handling](../protocols/task-lifecycle.md) — APPROVED triggers merge, REJECTED triggers revision
- 1.3.5 — [Hypothesis Exhaustion](../architecture/overview.md) — Two coder failures forces rescope
- 1.3.6 — [Iteration Limits](../protocols/task-lifecycle.md) — 10 coder iterations, 5 review cycles
- 1.3.7 — [Blocking Protocol](../protocols/task-lifecycle.md) — BLOCKED state with explicit reason

## Boundaries

**In scope:**
- Task state transitions
- Iteration and review cycles
- Limit enforcement
- Rescoping triggers

**Out of scope:**
- Blackboard structure (see 1.2 Multi-Agent Coordination)
- Git worktree operations (see 1.4 Worktree Isolation)
- Systemic failure detection (see 1.5 Circuit Breaker)
