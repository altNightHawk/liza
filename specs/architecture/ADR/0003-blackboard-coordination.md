# 3 - Blackboard Coordination Architecture

## Context and Problem Statement

Multiple agents need to coordinate autonomously. The behavioral contract (ADR-0001) disciplines individual agents, but agents need a mechanism to:
- Claim and hand off tasks
- Communicate approval/rejection decisions
- Make all state visible for human observation
- Support the gate mechanism without human-in-loop

## Considered Options

1. **Direct agent-to-agent communication** — Agents message each other
2. **Central orchestrator** — A meta-agent routes all communication
3. **Shared file-based blackboard** — Agents read/write shared state files
4. **Database-backed state** — PostgreSQL or similar for coordination

## Decision Outcome

Chose **Option 3**: Shared file-based blackboard in `.liza/` directory.

### Rationale

**No conversation between agents.** Read state, do work, write state. This eliminates the failure mode where agents negotiate, compromise, or drift collectively through dialogue.

**Everything visible, everything auditable.** The blackboard is human-readable YAML. You can `cat .liza/state.yaml` at any moment. No hidden handshakes between agents.

**Gates without human bottleneck.** The contract requires externalized reasoning before action. In pairing mode, that goes to the human. In MAS mode, it writes to the blackboard — same forcing function, different audience.

**Simplicity for POC.** File-based coordination is simple to implement, debug, and understand. The decision to use bash scripts (ADR-0005) reinforces this — both choices prioritize quick iteration over infrastructure complexity.

    └───────────┘        └──────────┘        └──────────┘
```

**Key state transitions in blackboard:**
- `UNCLAIMED` → `CLAIMED` (Coder claims task)
- `CLAIMED` → `READY_FOR_REVIEW` (Coder submits work)
- `READY_FOR_REVIEW` → `APPROVED` / `REJECTED` (Reviewer decides)
- `APPROVED` → `MERGED` (Supervisor merges)

**Atomic operations:** Scripts use `liza-lock.sh` for read-modify-write to prevent race conditions.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Full audit trail — every state change logged with timestamp and agent
- Human can observe, pause (`PAUSE` file), or intervene at any moment
- Agents are stateless — "every restart is a new mind with old artifacts"
- Simple debugging — `git diff .liza/state.yaml` shows exactly what changed

**Limitations accepted:**
- File-based locking is adequate for POC but may need revisiting at scale
- No real-time notification — agents poll the blackboard
- YAML can become unwieldy for large task lists (addressed by archiving)
