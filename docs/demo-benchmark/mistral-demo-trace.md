# Mistral Demo Trace

Trace of hello-cli demo with Mistral (Devstral-2) as the agent backend.

> See [DEMO.md](../DEMO.md) for test intructions.

---

## Summary

| Role | Iterations | Outcome |
|------|------------|---------|
| Planner | 1 | Created 3 tasks (TDD violation in planning) |
| Coder | 1 | Completed Task 1 with tests (fixed planner's TDD violation) |
| Reviewer | 1 | **Stuck in loop** — confused by unittest vs pytest |

Total loop: Plan (TDD violation) → Code (self-corrected) → Review (**infinite loop**)

**Key observation:** Coder compensated for planner's TDD violation, but reviewer got distracted investigating irrelevant unittest output instead of issuing verdict.

---

## Planner

Created 3 sequential tasks with dependencies. **Violated TDD enforcement** by splitting tests into a separate task.

### Initialization

Read contract files in sequence:
1. `specs/architecture/roles.md` — Role definition
2. `.liza/state.yaml` — Current blackboard state
3. `specs/protocols/task-lifecycle.md` — Task lifecycle
4. `specs/architecture/blackboard-schema.md` — State schema
5. `specs/architecture/state-machines.md` — State transitions
6. `specs/vision.md` — Goal spec

Also read `scripts/liza-add-task.sh` to understand task creation mechanism.

### Analysis

Did not inspect project directory structure before planning. Proceeded directly to task creation after reading specs.

### Tasks Created

Used `liza-add-task.sh` script for each task:

**Task 1: create-cli-structure** (Priority 1)
```bash
liza-add-task.sh \
  --id create-cli-structure \
  --desc "Create basic CLI structure with entry point" \
  --spec specs/vision.md \
  --done "CLI module exists and can be invoked with python -m hello" \
  --scope "Create __main__.py and basic module structure. Handle command-line argument parsing. No external dependencies." \
  --priority 1
```

**Task 2: implement-greeting-logic** (Priority 2)
```bash
liza-add-task.sh \
  --id implement-greeting-logic \
  --desc "Implement greeting logic with name parameter" \
  --spec specs/vision.md \
  --done "hello command prints 'Hello, World!' by default and 'Hello, <name>!' with --name argument" \
  --scope "Implement greeting function that handles default and custom names. Validate input. Return appropriate exit codes." \
  --priority 2 \
  --depends create-cli-structure
```

**Task 3: add-tests** (Priority 3)
```bash
liza-add-task.sh \
  --id add-tests \
  --desc "Add comprehensive tests for CLI functionality" \
  --spec specs/vision.md \
  --done "All tests pass covering default greeting, --name argument, and exit codes" \
  --scope "Create test suite covering main functionality. Include tests for default behavior, --name argument, and error cases. Use pytest framework." \
  --priority 3 \
  --depends implement-greeting-logic
```

All validations passed.

### State Updates

After task creation:
1. Set agent status to `IDLE`
2. Added alignment history entry: `"planning_complete"` with summary of 3 tasks
3. Validated blackboard state

### Session Stats

```
Steps:           17
Input Tokens:    585,494
Output Tokens:   1,364
Total Tokens:    586,858
Last Turn:       44,305
```

### Completion Statement

```
I have successfully completed the initial planning phase for the "Build hello CLI" goal.

Tasks Created:
1. create-cli-structure (Priority 1)
2. implement-greeting-logic (Priority 2) - Depends on create-cli-structure
3. add-tests (Priority 3) - Depends on implement-greeting-logic

Task Dependencies:
create-cli-structure → implement-greeting-logic → add-tests

The planning phase is now complete. The tasks are ready for coders to claim
and implement according to the Liza protocol.
```

## Coder — Pass 1

Implemented Task 1 with full functionality and tests, effectively completing Tasks 1-3 in a single pass.

### Initialization

Read contract files in sequence:
1. `specs/architecture/roles.md` — Coder role definition
2. `specs/protocols/task-lifecycle.md` — Task lifecycle
3. `specs/architecture/blackboard-schema.md` — State schema
4. `specs/architecture/state-machines.md` — State transitions
5. `.liza/state.yaml` — Current blackboard state (task details: CLAIMED, iteration 1)
6. `specs/vision.md` — Goal spec

### Worktree Verification

Correctly checked worktree state before starting:
```bash
cd /home/tangi/Workspace/hello-cli/.worktrees/create-cli-structure && pwd && ls -la
cd /home/tangi/Workspace/hello-cli/.worktrees/create-cli-structure && git status
```

**Note:** Unlike Gemini, Mistral correctly used the worktree path throughout the entire session.

### Implementation (TDD Order Violation)

**Created implementation first** (not TDD-compliant):

```python
# hello/__init__.py
# (empty module init)

# hello/__main__.py
import argparse

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Hello CLI")
    parser.add_argument("--name", default="World", help="Name to greet")
    args = parser.parse_args()
    print(f"Hello, {args.name}!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Manual verification:
- `python -m hello` → "Hello, World!" ✓
- `python -m hello --name Alice` → "Hello, Alice!" ✓

**Then wrote tests** (after implementation):

```python
# tests/test_cli.py
import subprocess
import sys

def test_default_greeting():
    result = subprocess.run([sys.executable, "-m", "hello"], capture_output=True, text=True)
    assert result.returncode == 0
    assert result.stdout.strip() == "Hello, World!"

def test_custom_name_greeting():
    result = subprocess.run([sys.executable, "-m", "hello", "--name", "Alice"], capture_output=True, text=True)
    assert result.returncode == 0
    assert result.stdout.strip() == "Hello, Alice!"

def test_exit_code():
    result = subprocess.run([sys.executable, "-m", "hello"], capture_output=True, text=True)
    assert result.returncode == 0
```

Test execution:
```
pytest tests/test_cli.py -v
3 passed
```

### Pre-commit Handling

Ran pre-commit, which modified files:
```bash
python -m pre_commit run --all-files
```

First commit attempt failed due to pre-commit modifications. Correctly handled by:
1. Checking git status
2. Reading modified files to understand changes
3. Re-staging modified files
4. Committing successfully

### Commit and Submit

```bash
git add hello/ tests/
git commit -m "feat: create basic CLI structure with entry point

- Add hello/__init__.py and hello/__main__.py
- Implement command-line argument parsing with argparse
- Add tests for default and custom name greetings
- Verify exit code 0 on success

Commit SHA: `8df36e617c97c3119585452afe6cebb0a66480a9`

Submitted via script:
```bash
/home/tangi/Workspace/liza/scripts/liza-submit-for-review.sh create-cli-structure 8df36e617c97c3119585452afe6cebb0a66480a9
```

Task status updated to `READY_FOR_REVIEW` in blackboard.

### Files Created

- `hello/__init__.py` — Module initialization
- `hello/__main__.py` — CLI entry point with argparse
- `tests/test_cli.py` — Test suite (3 tests)

### Scope Creep (Beneficial)

Task 1 scope was limited to "Create basic CLI structure with entry point" with done_when "CLI module exists and can be invoked with python -m hello".

However, the coder implemented:
- Full `--name` argument handling (Task 2 scope)
- Comprehensive test suite (Task 3 scope)

This **beneficial scope creep** effectively:
1. Fixed the planner's TDD violation by bundling tests
2. Completed all three tasks' functionality in one pass
3. Matches the Claude/Codex single-task approach

### Coder Good Practices

1. **Correct worktree usage** — All commands in `.worktrees/create-cli-structure`
2. **Manual verification** — Tested CLI before writing tests
3. **Pre-commit compliance** — Ran hooks, handled modifications correctly
4. **Proper commit** — Descriptive message, correct branch
5. **Script usage** — Used `liza-submit-for-review.sh` correctly
6. **State verification** — Read blackboard after submission

### Coder Issues

1. **TDD order violation** — Implementation before tests (should be tests first)
2. **Scope expansion** — Implemented beyond task boundaries (though beneficial)
3. **No pre-execution checkpoint** — Did not record checkpoint to blackboard before coding

---

## Reviewer — Pass 1: STUCK IN LOOP

Verified commit and ran tests, but got distracted investigating irrelevant unittest output. Never reached a verdict.

### Initialization

Read contract files:
1. `specs/architecture/roles.md` — Reviewer role definition
2. `skills/code-review/SKILL.md` — Code review protocol

### Verification (Correct)

1. **Verified HEAD matches REVIEW_COMMIT**: ✓
   ```bash
   git rev-parse HEAD
   # 8df36e617c97c3119585452afe6cebb0a66480a9
   ```

2. **Ran diff base→review**: ✓ (saw all changes correctly)
   ```bash
   git diff dfc1f07..8df36e6
   # Shows hello/__init__.py, hello/__main__.py, tests/test_cli.py
   ```

### Test Execution

**pytest (correct runner):**
```
pytest tests/ -v
3 passed in 0.09s
```

**pytest --collect-only:**
```
collected 3 items
  <Function test_default_greeting>
  <Function test_custom_name_greeting>
  <Function test_exit_code_success>
```

All tests passed. At this point, reviewer should have proceeded to verdict.

### The Distraction: unittest Discovery

Reviewer then ran:
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v
```

Output:
```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 0 tests in 0.000s

NO TESTS RAN
```

This is **expected behavior** — the tests use pytest-style functions (`def test_*`), not unittest-style classes (`class TestCase`). The project uses pytest (per `requirements-dev.txt`).

### Infinite Loop

Instead of recognizing this as irrelevant, the reviewer entered a loop:
1. `unittest discover ... | tail -20`
2. `unittest discover ... | grep "NO TESTS RAN"`
3. `unittest discover ... | cat`
4. `unittest discover ... | wc -l`
5. `unittest discover ... | wc -c`
6. `unittest discover ... | od -c | head -20`
7. `unittest discover ... | od -c | tail -20`
8. `unittest discover ... | od -c`
9. **Loop continues...**

The reviewer burned tokens investigating byte-level output of unittest discovery instead of:
1. Recognizing pytest is the correct test runner
2. Noting that pytest passed all tests
3. Issuing an APPROVED verdict

### Reviewer Issues

1. **Distraction by irrelevant tool** — unittest is not used by this project
2. **Failure to recognize test framework** — pytest-style tests don't work with unittest
3. **No verdict issued** — Never reached APPROVED/REJECTED decision
4. **Token waste** — Multiple variations of same failing command
5. **Missing context** — Didn't check `requirements-dev.txt` for test framework

### What Reviewer Should Have Done

1. Note pytest passed (3/3 tests) ✓
2. Verify done_when criteria:
   - `python -m hello` → "Hello, World!" ✓
   - `python -m hello --name Alice` → "Hello, Alice!" ✓
   - Tests pass ✓
3. Apply code-review skill P0-P3 checklist
4. Issue verdict: **APPROVED**

## Key Observations

### TDD Violation in Planning

The planner created `add-tests` as a separate task (Task 3) that depends on `implement-greeting-logic`. This violates the TDD enforcement rule from the contract:

> Each code task MUST include its own tests — do NOT create separate "add tests" tasks

The contract explicitly states:
> Code Reviewer will reject code tasks without tests covering done_when

This planning approach would result in:
- Coders implementing features without tests
- Tests written after implementation (not TDD)
- Reviewer rejection of tasks 1-2 for missing tests

### Waterfall Decomposition

Mistral used a waterfall-style decomposition with sequential dependencies:

```
create-cli-structure
       ↓
implement-greeting-logic
       ↓
add-tests
```

### Missing Project Structure Analysis

Unlike Codex, which inspected the project directory structure before planning, Mistral proceeded directly from reading specs to creating tasks. This may have contributed to the overly granular decomposition.

### Correct Script Usage

The planner correctly used `liza-add-task.sh` for atomic blackboard operations, with all validations passing. Also correctly updated agent status and alignment history.

### Good Practices Observed

1. **Spec-first approach** — Read all required specs before acting
2. **Atomic operations** — Used `liza-add-task.sh` script for safe blackboard writes
3. **Scope boundaries** — Clear scope definition for each task
4. **State hygiene** — Updated agent status to IDLE after completing planning
5. **Alignment tracking** — Added alignment history entry

### Bad Practices Observed

1. **TDD violation** — Tests split into separate task
2. **No project inspection** — Didn't examine existing project structure
3. **Overly granular** — 3 tasks for a simple "Hello World" CLI
4. **Waterfall thinking** — Sequential dependencies create bottleneck

### Impact on Sprint Execution

The planner's waterfall decomposition created a deadlock scenario:
- Tasks 1-2 require tests to pass review
- Tests are gated behind Task 3
- Task 3 depends on Task 2
- Task 2 depends on Task 1
- Task 1 rejected for missing tests → infinite loop

**The coder self-corrected** by bundling tests with Task 1, breaking the deadlock.

**But the reviewer failed** by getting stuck in a loop investigating unittest output. The sprint is blocked not by code quality but by reviewer confusion.

**If the reviewer had issued APPROVED:**
- Task 1 would be complete (with tests)
- Tasks 2-3 would become redundant (functionality already implemented)
- Sprint would complete with only Task 1 merged

This demonstrates a new failure mode: **reviewer distraction loops**.

### Contract Compliance Summary

**Planner:**

| Requirement | Compliance | Notes |
|-------------|------------|-------|
| TDD enforcement | **Violated** | Separate test task |
| Atomic blackboard ops | Compliant | Used `liza-add-task.sh` |
| State hygiene | Compliant | Status updated to IDLE |
| Alignment tracking | Compliant | History entry added |
| Validation | Compliant | Schema validated |
| Source declaration | Partial | Listed tasks, not files read |

**Coder:**

| Requirement | Compliance | Notes |
|-------------|------------|-------|
| TDD order | **Violated** | Implementation before tests |
| Tests bundled | **Compliant** | Fixed planner's violation via scope creep |
| Worktree protocol | Compliant | Correct path throughout |
| Git protocol | Compliant | Proper commit and branch |
| Pre-commit | Compliant | Ran hooks, handled changes |
| Script usage | Compliant | Used `liza-submit-for-review.sh` |
| Pre-execution checkpoint | **Violated** | No checkpoint recorded |
| Manual verification | Compliant | Tested CLI output |

**Reviewer:**

| Requirement | Compliance | Notes |
|-------------|------------|-------|
| Commit verification | Compliant | HEAD matched REVIEW_COMMIT |
| Diff review | Compliant | base→review diff examined |
| Test execution | Compliant | pytest ran, 3/3 passed |
| Done_when verification | **Not reached** | Loop before manual verification |
| Code-review skill | Partial | Read skill, didn't complete P0-P3 |
| Verdict issued | **Failed** | Never called `liza-submit-verdict.sh` |
| Focus discipline | **Violated** | Distracted by irrelevant unittest |

---

## Overall Assessment

| Phase | Compliance | Outcome |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Planner | **Violated** | TDD enforcement (separate test task) |
| Coder | **Partial** | Fixed TDD bundling, violated TDD order |
| Reviewer | **Failed** | Stuck in unittest investigation loop |

**Sprint viability:** Blocked — reviewer never issued verdict

Unlike Gemini's catastrophic repository corruption, Mistral's failure is recoverable:
- Planner created flawed task structure
- Coder compensated by bundling tests (scope creep)
- Repository state remains clean
- Task 1 covers all functionality
- **Reviewer got distracted**, never approved/rejected

**Recovery path:** Kill reviewer, restart with fresh agent, or manually approve

---

## Recommendations

### For Planner

1. **Single task approach**: Combine all 3 tasks into one with tests bundled
2. **Project inspection**: Read directory structure before planning
3. **Explicit TDD reference**: The done_when should mention tests
4. **Smaller scope**: "Hello World" is a single cohesive feature

Corrected single task:
```bash
liza-add-task.sh \
  --id implement-hello-cli \
  --desc "Implement hello CLI with greeting logic and tests" \
  --spec specs/vision.md \
  --done "python -m hello prints 'Hello, World!' (exit 0); python -m hello --name Alice prints 'Hello, Alice!' (exit 0); tests cover both behaviors and pass" \
  --scope "IN: CLI entrypoint, argparse, greeting output, tests. OUT: packaging, docs, CI" \
  --priority 1
```

### For Coder

1. **TDD order**: Write tests FIRST, then implementation
2. **Pre-execution checkpoint**: Record intent/assumptions to blackboard before coding
3. **Scope awareness**: Note when exceeding task scope (beneficial but should be explicit)

### For Reviewer

1. **Identify test framework first**: Check `requirements-dev.txt` or project config
2. **Don't investigate irrelevant tools**: If pytest passes, unittest compatibility is not required
3. **Issue verdict**: After verifying done_when criteria, issue APPROVED or REJECTED
4. **Avoid loops**: If a command gives unexpected output, reason about it once, don't repeat with variations
